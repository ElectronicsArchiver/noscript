Winner of the "PC World World Class Award".

It allows JavaScript, Flash, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking site, mitigating remotely exploitable vulnerabilities including Spectre and Meltdown.

It  protects your "trust boundaries" against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), cross-zone DNS rebinding / CSRF attacks (router hacking), and Clickjacking attempts, thanks to its unique ClearClick technology.

Such a preemptive approach  prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality where you need it.
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript ;-)
